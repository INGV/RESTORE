<h2>About</h2>

RESTORE is a powerful tool to takle the short-term aftershock incompleteness issue (STAI).
It is based on a stochastic gap-filling procedure, which reconstructs the missing events in the space-time-magnitude domain based on empirical earthquake properties. The subsets of the catalog that are affected by the STAI issue are automatically detected.


**RESTORE files**:

*Run_RESTORE.py* loads the seismic catalog, sets the input parameters and runs *RESTORE.py*

*RESTORE.py* is the main module

*Synthetic_example_ETAS.py* runs the synthetic test (uses *ETAS_incomplete.txt* as input dataset)


**Dataset included**:

*ETAS_complete.txt* is the synthetic dataset (before STAI modeling)

*ETAS_incomplete.txt* is the synthetic dataset (after STAI modeling)

Compare the replenished catalog with *ETAS_complete.txt*, to check how the missing events are reconstructed by RESTORE

<h2>Requirements</h2>

Python 3

statsmodels >= 0.12.1

basemap <= 1.2.1

matplotlib < 3.0.0
